### Debugging

ESP32-S3 support on OpenOCD is available upstream as of version 0.12.0. Download and install OpenOCD from [OpenOCD](https://github.com/openocd-org/openocd)

ESP32-S3 has a built-in JTAG circuitry and can be debugged without any additional chip. Only an USB cable connected to the D+/D- pins is necessary.

Further documentation can be obtained from the SoC vendor in [JTAG debugging for ESP32-S3](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s3/api-guides/jtag-debugging/)
